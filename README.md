# COMT_Project [Project Name: Street Fighter]
This was a Year 1 Student Project. The module this was for was Computational Thinking(COMT), which was completed in the Year 2023.

My thoughts: 
This was my first time learning the coding Language Python. I had a great learning experience, and it gave me a foundation of what coding is. Sparking my interest in Python and seeing its reach and capabilities made me excited. 

Reflection: 
Being 1st year student, coding this game project was a fruitful experience. When I was working on my code, there were many times when I would spend hours debugging, and when I would leave for a break, I would question if I was productive. It was very demotivating. However, coding is a game of patience and calmness. When coding, things can get messy very fast. I would reflect to see how I have coded thus far and see what changes could be made.



The following is a summary of my project;

This is the Game Mode Options
1) Automated Game
2) Manual Game

Automated Game -> Consists of Randomized Speed Power(SP) & Attack Power(AP) (variables) of the enemy during a game fight. Enemy character is randomly picked as well

Manual Game -> User picks their own character & the user will have the same Speed Power (Power) as the enemy

Here, the user could 'Attack' & 'Defend' using the character's strengths. They could 'Fire', 'Water', 'Air' & more according to the character the user uses.
